            <p>My mum's dad apparently started balding in his 20s, but my Dad doesn't reckon he did based on the timeline. My mum's side has a history of bad discs in their backs, but otherwise I've got a pretty healthy heritage.</p>

            <p>If what is causing me stress is not in my control, then I'll generally just roll with the punches, but if it's within my control I'll look through my options while sitting in silence.</p>

                    <h3>1: Art Gallery / Museum Tour</h3>
                    <p>Find an Art Gallery / Museum we'd like to visit together and plan a day trip.</p>
                    <p>Afterwards, we can go to lunch/dinner at a nearby restaurant we haven't been to before.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>2: Travel to a restaurant we have not tried before.</h3>
                    <p>Taking inspiration from the previous date idea, we can take a drive to a restaurant we haven't been to before.</p>
                    <p>Afterwards we can go home and take a warm bath together to bring the romantic day to a close.</p>

                    <h3>3: Home Spa Day</h3>
                    <p>We can set up a relaxing environment with candles, soothing music, and essential oils. Take turns giving each other massages, facials, and enjoying a hot bath.</p>
                    <p>This can also be done by going to a private spa, or an AirBnB with a hot tub, or even set up a television to watch a movie while we relax.</p>

                    <h3>4: Stay-at-Home Themed Movie Night</h3>
                    <p>We can plan a whole day or just a night to build a mini-theatre near our TV, picking a specific theme. We pick a series of shows or movies around this theme, and binge them for as long as we like.</p>
                    <p>We can also cook foods and make cocktails/mocktails centered around our theme to give us a chance to stretch our legs during the binge-watching.</p>

                    <h3>5: Cooking / Baking Challenge</h3>
                    <p>Have a cooking or baking challenge at home where you both pick a recipe to make for each other. Spend the evening cooking together, sharing tips, and enjoying the meals you've created.</p>
